For each part I chose:
* One approach where I laid it out in a single intellegible line

To get some performance statistics:
* python -m timeit -s "from solution_part1_oneline import solve" "solve(open('input.txt'))"
* python -m timeit -s "from solution_part2_oneline import solve" "solve(open('input.txt'))"

Works fine with latest python 2 and 3.
